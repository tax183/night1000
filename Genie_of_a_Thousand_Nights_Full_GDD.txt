GENIE OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS Full Game Design Documentation (GDD) Version
1.0

  ------------------
  1. GAME OVERVIEW
  ------------------

Genie of a Thousand Nights is a 2D side-scrolling arcade game inspired
by Flappy Bird mechanics but redesigned around environmental control
instead of direct character movement.

The player does NOT control the Genie directly. The Genie moves
automatically along a fixed horizontal path.

The player controls the vertical movement of obstacles
(columns/minarets) to create safe openings for the Genie to pass
through.

Theme: Arabian Nights (One Thousand and One Nights) Genre: Arcade /
Endless Runner Platform: Mobile / PC Engine Recommendation: Unity 2D
(URP)

  ---------------------------
  2. CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANIC
  ---------------------------

Character Movement: - The Genie moves forward automatically at constant
speed. - Vertical movement follows a fixed smooth hover path OR slight
auto-drift. - Player cannot directly move the Genie.

Obstacle Control Mechanic: - Obstacles consist of top and bottom
vertical structures. - Player adjusts obstacle height in real-time.

Input Options: Option A: - Tap right side of screen = Move obstacles
upward - Tap left side of screen = Move obstacles downward

Option B: - Drag obstacle vertically to reposition gap

Constraints: - Obstacles have MinHeight and MaxHeight limits. - Movement
uses smooth interpolation (Lerp). - Slight delay can be added for
difficulty scaling.

Objective: - Align gap with Genie’s current height. - Collect lanterns
placed between obstacles. - Survive as long as possible.

  -------------------

Lantern Types:

Bronze Lantern: - +1 Score

Silver Lantern: - Temporary slow motion

Golden Lantern: - Ability unlock progress

Cursed Lantern: - Doubles score but increases difficulty temporarily

Spawn Logic: - Appears centered in obstacle gap - Occasionally placed
off-center for skill challenge
