## 3. Game Description
In "The Thousandth Night," you don't control the heroes; you control the world around them. As Aladdin and Jasmine navigate through dangerous trials, you must manipulate the environment by dragging pillars, clouds, and mirrors to ensure their safety. It’s a unique take on the puzzle-action genre that focuses on protection and environmental mastery rather than direct character movement.

## 4. Theme Implementation
The game reflects the "Reversed Roles" theme by flipping the perspective of a traditional obstacle-dodging game. Instead of the player jumping to avoid the environment, the player "is" the environment, moving obstacles out of the heroes' way. This represents the theme through gameplay mechanics and player experience.

## 5. How to Play
1.  **Stage 1:** Drag pillars vertically or use Arrow Keys to clear a path for the carpet.
2.  **Stage 2:** Slide magical cloud shields to block fireballs rising from below.
3.  **Stage 3:** Position the golden mirror to reflect the Shadow Boss's purple magic back at him.
4.  **Objective:** Keep the health bar above zero and reach the end of all three levels.
